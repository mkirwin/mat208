(*Problem 5: divideAll takes two ints and returns the result of dividing the first by the second
 * It should return a tuple with components: 
     * the integer quotient,
     * the integer remainder,
     * the real quotient*)

(*Problem 6: Write a function, reverse, that takes a string and reverses it.*)
fun reverse("") = ""

(*Problem 7: Write a function that computes a geometric series, taking n, a, and r.*)
fun exp(a,0) = 1.0
